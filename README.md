# ‚öôÔ∏èSEManager
SEManager is a handy package that allows you to play sound effects without being aware of the AudioSource.
Once SEManager is installed in your project, it will be automatically generated when the game is run.

``` Sample code.cs
// Play
clip.Play();
// Set volume, priority, and delay time.
PlayDelayed(1f, 0.5f, 127);
// Set multiple audio clips, volume, pitch, pitch range, and priority.
new SEClip(clips, 0.5f, 1f, 0.1f, 127).Play();
````

## üìù Notes

You can change the maximum number of simultaneous plays from SEManager / Resources / SEManagerSettings.asset.
You can change the volume from SEManager / SEAudioMixer.mixer (for playback with AudioSource specified, specify SEAudioMixer for AudioMixer).
# üíøSEClip
SEClip is a ScriptableObject that can be used to make sound effects less monotonous. When played back with multiple AudioClips and a pitch blur range, the sound effect will sound with a random AudioClip and pitch. This allows for variation in the sound of bullets, footsteps, etc. Playback can be done on SEManager in the same way as with AudioClip.

|clips|multiple AudioClips|
|priority|priority|
|volume|volume|
|pitch|pitch|pitchRange
|pitch|pitchRange|pitch blur range|
